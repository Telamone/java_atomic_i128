# Atomic ðŸ‘¾ 128-bit integer

This is (like <a href="https://github.com/Telamone/Dilithium">Dilithium</a>) an <b>external</b> piece
of my <a href="https://github.com/Telamone/TelLibrary">library</a> (<i>currently in development</i>)
that I decided to put open source for those who need <b>128-bit integers</b> with their respective 
common and <b>atomic</b> operations.

The java version used is <b>24</b> and <i>might change in the future</i>.


# Coming soon...
